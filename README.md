# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project using Microsoft SQL Server

This GitHub project showcases a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using Microsoft SQL Server. The project leverages the power and capabilities of SQL Server to collect, clean, transform, and visualize COVID-19 data from various sources. The goal is to provide insights and valuable information to help understand the impact of the pandemic.

Data Exploration based on questions such as: <br>

Total Cases vs Total Population<br>
Death Percentage in a country <br>
Highest Death Count compared to population <br>
Total vaccinations done vs Total Population <br>
All time COVID-19 record <br>

In this COVID-19 data analysis project, I employed a variety of advanced SQL techniques to manipulate and analyze the data effectively. These techniques include:<br>

Join Functions: To integrate data from multiple sources, I utilized SQL self join function. Join function helped me combine related datasets based on common keys, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data. <br>

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): CTEs were employed to simplify complex queries and improve code readability. By defining temporary result sets within CTEs, I could break down the analysis into manageable steps and reuse common subqueries efficiently. <br>

Window Functions: Window functions, such as OVER(), played a crucial role in performing time-based analysis. These functions allowed me to identify trends over time within specific categories. <br>

Views: Views were created to encapsulate complex SQL queries into easily accessible virtual tables. This not only simplified the querying process but also improved data security by limiting direct access to the underlying data tables. <br>
